# BMR-Calculator
My JavaFx implementation of a BMR calculator in Java

# Description

## Basal metabolic rate (BMR)
Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories you burn as your body performs basic (basal) life-sustaining function. Commonly also termed as Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), which is the calories burned if you stayed in bed all day.  In either case, many utilize the basal metabolic rate formula to calculate their body’s metabolism rate.

Your BMR defines your basal metabolism rate which makes up about 60-70% of the calories we use (“burn” or expend). This includes the energy your body uses to maintain the basic function of your living and breathing body, including:
* The beating of our heart
* Cell production
* Respiration
* The maintenance of body temperature
* Circulation
* Nutrient processing  
 
Your unique metabolism rate, or BMR, is influenced by a number of factors including age, weight, height, gender, environmental temperature, dieting, and exercise habits.
